# Hospital-Inventory-Management-System
Problem Statement Considering the ongoing global pandemic situation, the need for digitizing Healthcare Inventory  Management is a necessity. The currently manual data maintenance causes following difficulties: ● Fails to track availability of surgical instruments.  ● Fails to provide timely updated availability of all types of drugs. ● Susceptible to manual error or manipulation. ● Shortage or overstocking of medical supplies. ● Inventory auditing is a tedious time-consuming task. ● Operationally and financially costly to manage records. ● Financial Transaction scrutiny is tedious and time-consuming. Objective The aim of this project is to design, develop and implement a digitized Healthcare Inventory  Management with ensuing features: ● Faster, digitized, and semi-automated stock counting, ordering, and rotation of drugs and  surgical instruments. ● Along with inventory data, the database will also include records on surgeons, doctors, and  nurses. ● Customer Data will allow for feedback that improves customer relationships as well as  absolute care of patients. ● Inventory updated after every transaction for drugs and instruments.  ● Real-time Inventory management allows customers to view available drugs and place  orders accordingly  ● Automatically restrict access to Scheduled Drugs to prevent illegal activities. ● The Healthcare inventory management system also involves the clinical sphere of  healthcare service performance.
